# rename_and_move_files.sh-in-remote-machine
This script renames all files in a remote server directory that match the pattern  #              "3gpp_3D_UMA_NLOS_M_512_velo500*.mat". The files are renamed sequentially starting  #              from a specified number and are moved to a new directory called "changedfiles".
